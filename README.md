# bankSystem
This is a simple banking system in Java, applying OOP principles. The project tests my skills in creating classes, instantiating objects, and using an ArrayList to manage accounts. I iterate over the accounts to print the owner, balance, and provide a withdraw method via an interface for the two child classes.
